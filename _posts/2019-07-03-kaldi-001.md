1. apt-get
2. subversion
3. automake
4. autoconf
5. libtool
6. g++
7. zlib
8. libatal
9. wget
具体安装方法如下:
>  
sudo apt-get install autoconf automaker gcc g++ libtool subversion gawk  
sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran zlib1g-dev

Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit
================================

To build the toolkit: see `./INSTALL`.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux; Darwin; and Cygwin (has not been
tested on more "exotic" varieties of UNIX).  For Windows installation
instructions (excluding Cygwin), see `windows/INSTALL`.

To run the example system builds, see `egs/README.txt`

If you encounter problems (and you probably will), please do not hesitate to
contact the developers (see below). In addition to specific questions, please
let us know if there are specific aspects of the project that you feel could be
improved, that you find confusing, etc., and which missing features you most
wish it had.

Kaldi information channels
--------------------------

For HOT news about Kaldi see [the project site](http://kaldi-asr.org/).

[Documentation of Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/):
- Info about the project, description of techniques, tutorial for C++ coding.
- Doxygen reference of the C++ code.

[Kaldi forums and mailing lists](http://kaldi-asr.org/forums.html):

We have two different lists
- User list kaldi-help
- Developer list kaldi-developers:

To sign up to any of those mailing lists, go to

Development pattern for contributors
------------------------------------

1. [Create a personal fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
   of the [main Kaldi repository](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from `master`, e.g. you create
   a branch `my-awesome-feature`.
3. [Generate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
   through the Web interface of GitHub.
4. As a general rule, please follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
   There are a [few exceptions in Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/style.html).
   You can use the [Google's cpplint.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/cpplint/cpplint.py)
   to verify that your code is free of basic mistakes.

Platform specific notes
-----------------------

### PowerPC 64bits little-endian (ppc64le)

- Kaldi is expected to work out of the box in RHEL >= 7 and Ubuntu >= 16.04 with
  OpenBLAS, ATLAS, or CUDA.
- CUDA drivers for ppc64le can be found at [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- An [IBM Redbook](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5169.html) is
  available as a guide to install and configure CUDA.

### Android

- Kaldi supports cross compiling for Android using Android NDK, clang++ and
  OpenBLAS.
- See [this blog post](http://jcsilva.github.io/2017/03/18/compile-kaldi-android/)
  for details.
```

>cat INSTALL  

```text
This is the official Kaldi INSTALL. Look also at INSTALL.md for the git mirror installation.
[for native Windows install, see windows/INSTALL]

(1)
go to tools/  and follow INSTALL instructions there.

(2)
go to src/ and follow INSTALL instructions there.

```

第一步进入tools/
>cd tools/  
cat INSTALL  

```text
To check the prerequisites for Kaldi, first run

  extras/check_dependencies.sh

and see if there are any system-level installations you need to do. Check the
output carefully. There are some things that will make your life a lot easier
if you fix them at this stage. If your system default C++ compiler is not
supported, you can do the check with another compiler by setting the CXX
environment variable, e.g.

  CXX=g++-4.8 extras/check_dependencies.sh

Then run

  make

which by default will install ATLAS headers, OpenFst, SCTK and sph2pipe.
OpenFst requires a relatively recent C++ compiler with C++11 support, e.g.
g++ >= 4.7, Apple clang >= 5.0 or LLVM clang >= 3.3. If your system default
compiler does not have adequate support for C++11, you can specify a C++11
compliant compiler as a command argument, e.g.

  make CXX=g++-4.8

If you have multiple CPUs and want to speed things up, you can do a parallel
build by supplying the "-j" option to make, e.g. to use 4 CPUs

  make -j 4

In extras/, there are also various scripts to install extra bits and pieces that
are used by individual example scripts.  If an example script needs you to run
one of those scripts, it will tell you what to do.
```

设置参数，加快编译速度
> make -j 4  

安装 IRSTLM
>extras/install_irstlm.sh

第二步进入src/
>cd ../src/  
cat INSTALL  

```text

These instructions are valid for UNIX-like systems (these steps have
been run on various Linux distributions; Darwin; Cygwin).  For native Windows
compilation, see ../windows/INSTALL.

You must first have completed the installation steps in ../tools/INSTALL
(compiling OpenFst; getting ATLAS and CLAPACK headers).

The installation instructions are

  ./configure --shared
  make depend -j 8
  make -j 8

Note that we added the "-j 8" to run in parallel because "make" takes a long
time.  8 jobs might be too many for a laptop or small desktop machine with not
many cores.

For more information, see documentation at http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/
and click on "The build process (how Kaldi is compiled)".
```

>./configure --shared  
make depend -j 8  
make -j 8
